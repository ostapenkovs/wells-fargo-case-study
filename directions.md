Setting:

You are working in the consumer lending modeling team of a hypothetical financial institution (XYZ) and are assigned to 
build a model for use in an automated credit approval process for personal loans. You are given Personal Loan performance 
data containing one binary response called ‘Status’ and a set of predictor variables from those Personal Loan accounts. 
Each record in the data represents a unique account.  
 
There are two datasets:

1. Training data with 20,000 accounts for calibrating the models 
2. Testing data with 5,000 accounts for evaluating the models. Additional information about the data is available in 
the data section. 
 
Objectives:

1. Conduct an exploratory analysis of the data, provide data summary, and make any necessary data pre-processing 
for modeling. 
2. Fit a logistic regression (LR) model, assess its performance, and interpret the results.  
3. Develop a machine learning (ML) model using one of the following algorithms: 
    a. Decision Trees 
    b. Gradient Boosting 
    c. Feedforward Neural Networks  
4. Compare the results from the LR model and the ML model and make a recommendation of which one to use for 
approving applications for Personal Loan. Please clearly state your reasons. 
5. Describe how you would use the selected model for credit approval and address the following business questions: 
    a. Suppose an application is rejected using your model, and the applicant asks for a reason. How would you 
explain the results to the customer? 
    b. Do female customers have lower approval rate in your model? 
6. What additional data you would you collect to improve your model performance?
